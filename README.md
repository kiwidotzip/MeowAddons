<h2 align="center">Installation Steps</h2>

### **Automatic way**

- /ct import meowaddons (may be an older version)

### **Manual way**

#### **Getting the module zip**
First we need MeowAddons.zip, for this we'll head over to the [release page](https://github.com/kiwidotzip/MeowAddons/releases/) for the newest version and click the MeowAddons.zip in the latest release

#### **Dependencies (No need to do this, for now)**

Download [Dependencies.zip](https://github.com/kiwidotzip/randomstuff/releases/tag/meowaddonsdependencies)

#### **Wrapping things up**
Once we have all of our folders (aka "modules") we can now go in game and type `/ct files` and hit enter<br>
A file window will pop up, we open the folder that is called `modules` and paste all of the folders that we have gathered thus far<br>
After that we can head back over in game and type `/ct load` and hit enter.<br>
And that should be it, you _should_ have properly manually installed the desired module.
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure that the folders do not have a folder inside otherwise the module will not work properly.<br>
> for example: If i unzipped Vigilance-1.3.2 and it has a folder inside called Vigilance this folder inside is the module itself that i need
